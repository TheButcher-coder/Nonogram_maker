# Nonogram_maker
Makes a BW Nonogram from an image
- The Goal is to write a Program that reads an Image to a 2D Vector field and generates a nonogram from it.
- The Nonogram should then be saved to PGM or SVG depending on uses.
- It should scale the Pixels accordingly to the size of the original image
- I should learn to use git better :P
